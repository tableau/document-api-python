# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project!

Contribution can include, but are not limited to, any of the following:

* File an Issue
* Request a Feature
* Implement a Requested Feature
* Fix an Issue/Bug
* Add/Fix documentation

Contributions must follow the guidelines outlined on the [Tableau Organization](http://tableau.github.io/) page, though filing an issue or requesting
a feature do not require the CLA.

## Issues and Feature Requests

To submit an issue/bug report, or to request a feature, please submit a [github issue](https://github.com/tableau/document-api-python/issues) to the repo.

If you are submiting a bug report, please provide as much information as you can, including clear and concise repro steps, attaching any necessary
files to assist in the repro.  **Be sure to scrub the files of any potentially sensitive information.  Issues are public.**

For a feature request, please try to describe the scenario you are trying to accomplish that requires the feature.  This will help us understand
the limitations that you are running into, and provide us with a use case to know if we've satisfied your request.

## Fixes, Implementations, and Documentation

For all other things, please submit a PR that includes the fix, documentation, or new code that you are trying to contribute.  More information on
creating a PR can be found in the [github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

If the feature is complex or has multiple solutions that could be equally appropriate approaches, it would be helpful to file an issue to discuss the
design trade-offs of each solution before implementing, to allow us to collectively arrive at the best solution, which most likely exists in the middle
somewhere.
